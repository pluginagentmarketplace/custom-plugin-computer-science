# Security & Compliance

## Quick Start

Security must be integrated throughout the development lifecycle:

### Security Fundamentals
- Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA triad)
- Threat modeling and risk assessment
- Defense in depth strategies
- Security by design principles

### Secure Coding

#### Common Vulnerabilities
- **OWASP Top 10**: Injection, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure
- **Input Validation**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection prevention
- **Output Encoding**: Preventing XSS and injection attacks
- **Access Control**: Authorization bypass, privilege escalation

#### Secure Practices
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding
- Parameterized queries
- Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- Secure defaults and fail securely

### Authentication & Authorization
- Password security (hashing, salting, bcrypt)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
- JWT and session management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)

### Cryptography
- Symmetric encryption (AES)
- Asymmetric encryption (RSA)
- Hash functions (SHA-256)
- Digital signatures
- Key management and rotation
- Certificate management (TLS/SSL)

### Infrastructure Security
- Network security (firewalls, VPNs)
- Container image scanning
- Infrastructure as code security
- Secrets management
- Database encryption

## Key Security Domains

### Application Security
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- Dependency scanning and vulnerability management
- Code review security practices
- Secure API design

### Cloud Security
- Identity and access management (IAM)
- Network security groups
- Data protection and encryption
- Compliance in cloud (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Cloud configuration hardening

### Incident Response
- Detection and monitoring
- Containment strategies
- Root cause analysis
- Recovery procedures
- Post-incident review

### Compliance & Standards
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data security
- **PCI-DSS**: Payment card security
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **SOC 2**: Service organization controls
