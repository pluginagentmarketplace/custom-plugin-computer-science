# Programming Languages & Fundamentals

## Quick Start

Every programmer should understand core CS concepts regardless of language:

### Computer Science Essentials
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, recursion
- **Complexity Analysis**: Big O notation, space-time tradeoffs
- **Design Patterns**: Common reusable solutions to problems

### Popular Programming Languages

#### JavaScript/TypeScript
- ES6+ features and async programming
- Node.js runtime
- Browser APIs and DOM manipulation
- Modern frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)

#### Python
- Versatile ecosystem
- Data science and machine learning
- Web frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- Automation and scripting

#### Java
- Enterprise applications
- Object-oriented principles
- Spring Framework ecosystem
- Performance and scalability

#### Go
- Concurrency with goroutines
- Simple and readable syntax
- Cloud-native applications
- High performance

#### Rust
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Performance and reliability
- Systems programming
- Async/await patterns

#### C++
- Object-oriented programming
- Performance-critical systems
- Game development
- STL and modern C++ features

### Programming Paradigms
- **Object-Oriented**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism
- **Functional**: Pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions
- **Imperative**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Declarative**: Specify what, not how
