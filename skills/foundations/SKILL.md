# CS Foundations

## Quick Start

Computer science is built on mathematics. Master these fundamentals:

### Core Topics

**Discrete Mathematics**
- Set theory and operations
- Logic and proof techniques
- Combinatorics and counting
- Number theory basics
- Relations and functions

**Computational Thinking**
- Problem decomposition
- Abstraction and generalization
- Pattern recognition
- Algorithmic thinking

**Formal Logic**
- Propositional logic
- Predicate logic
- Proof by induction
- Truth tables and logical equivalence

## Learning Path

**Week 1: Logic Basics**
- Boolean algebra
- Truth tables
- Logical operators
- Inference rules

**Week 2: Proof Techniques**
- Direct proof
- Proof by contradiction
- Mathematical induction
- Strong induction

**Week 3: Set Theory**
- Set operations (∪, ∩, complement)
- Cartesian product
- Relations
- Equivalence relations

**Week 4: Functions**
- Function notation
- Domain, codomain, range
- One-to-one and onto
- Function composition

**Week 5: Combinatorics**
- Counting principles
- Permutations
- Combinations
- Pigeonhole principle

**Week 6: Number Theory**
- Modular arithmetic
- Prime numbers
- GCD and Euclidean algorithm
- Congruence

**Week 7-8: Graph Basics**
- Graph representations
- Basic properties
- Paths and cycles
- Connectivity

## Practice Problems

1. Prove by induction that 1+2+...+n = n(n+1)/2
2. Prove √2 is irrational
3. Show A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
4. Count functions from {1,2,3} to {a,b}
5. Solve: x ≡ 5 (mod 12) and x ≡ 3 (mod 8)

## Key Concepts

- **Axioms**: Statements we assume true
- **Theorems**: Statements we prove
- **Lemmas**: Helper theorems
- **Corollaries**: Results that follow easily

## Why It Matters

These foundations enable:
- Understanding algorithm correctness

- Designing new algorithms
- Proving algorithm properties
- Understanding what's computable

## Interview Prep

- Explain mathematical induction
- Prove that a function is injective
- Count permutations with constraints
