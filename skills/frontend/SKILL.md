# Frontend Development

## Quick Start

Frontend development involves building user-facing applications using web technologies. Here's how to get started:

### Core Technologies
- **HTML**: Learn semantic markup, forms, and accessibility
- **CSS**: Master layouts (flexbox, grid), animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Understand DOM manipulation, async/await, event handling

### Getting Started Path
1. Start with HTML & CSS fundamentals (roadmap.sh/html, roadmap.sh/css)
2. Learn JavaScript fundamentals (roadmap.sh/javascript)
3. Master TypeScript for type safety (roadmap.sh/typescript)
4. Choose a framework (React, Vue, or Angular)
5. Learn state management and testing

## Modern Frontend Frameworks

### React Ecosystem
- Components and JSX
- Hooks and state management
- Next.js for full-stack development
- React Native for mobile

### Vue.js
- Single File Components
- Composition API
- Ecosystem: Pinia, Nuxt
- Reactive data binding

### Angular
- Component-based architecture
- Dependency injection
- RxJS for reactive programming
- Strong tooling and conventions

## Frontend Development Practices

### Performance Optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization
- Caching strategies
- Core Web Vitals

### Accessibility (a11y)
- WCAG guidelines
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation

### Testing
- Unit testing (Jest, Vitest)
- Component testing (Testing Library)
- E2E testing (Cypress, Playwright)
- Visual regression testing

### Build Tools
- Module bundlers (Webpack, Vite, Esbuild)
- Task runners and scripts
- CSS preprocessing (SASS, PostCSS)
- CSS-in-JS solutions
