# DevOps & Infrastructure

## Quick Start

DevOps combines development and operations to automate and streamline software delivery:

### Foundation
- Linux fundamentals and command line
- Git version control and workflows
- Shell scripting and automation
- Networking basics

### Core DevOps Technologies

#### Containerization
- **Docker**: Images, containers, registries
- **Container networking** and volumes
- **Docker Compose** for multi-container apps
- Image optimization and security

#### Orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Pods, deployments, services
- Helm for package management
- StatefulSets and DaemonSets
- Service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)

#### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**: Resource provisioning
- **CloudFormation** for AWS
- **Ansible** for configuration management
- Declarative infrastructure

#### Cloud Platforms
- **AWS**: EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, VPC
- **Google Cloud**: Compute Engine, Cloud Run
- **Azure**: VMs, App Service, managed databases
- **Cloudflare**: CDN and edge computing

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- Automated testing and building
- Deployment automation
- Release management

## Key Skills

### Infrastructure Management
- Cloud architecture and design
- Network configuration and security
- Storage and database management
- Cost optimization

### Monitoring & Observability
- Prometheus for metrics
- ELK Stack for logging
- Distributed tracing
- Alerting and incident management

### Security
- Infrastructure security
- Container image scanning
- Secret management
- Network policies and firewalls

### Automation
- Infrastructure provisioning
- Configuration management
- Deployment automation
- Self-healing systems
