# Software Architecture & System Design

## Quick Start

Great architecture ensures systems are scalable, maintainable, and reliable:

### Foundational Concepts
- SOLID principles for code design
- Design patterns (creational, structural, behavioral)
- Architectural patterns (layered, hexagonal, microservices)
- Trade-offs in system design

### System Design Principles

#### Scalability
- Horizontal vs. vertical scaling
- Load balancing and distribution
- Database sharding and replication
- Caching strategies (multi-level caching)

#### Reliability & Resilience
- Fault tolerance and redundancy
- Circuit breakers and bulkheads
- Timeout and retry strategies
- Health checks and monitoring

#### Performance
- Bottleneck identification
- Database optimization
- Caching strategies
- Asynchronous processing

#### Data Management
- Database schema design
- Normalization and denormalization
- CAP theorem and consistency models
- Eventually consistent systems

### Architectural Patterns

#### Monolithic Architecture
- Layered architecture
- Clean architecture
- Hexagonal (ports and adapters)

#### Distributed Architecture
- Microservices
- Service mesh
- API gateway patterns
- CQRS and event sourcing

#### Event-Driven Architecture
- Event publishers and subscribers
- Message brokers
- Stream processing
- Eventual consistency

## Key Skills

### Design Decisions
- Technology selection
- Framework and library choices
- Database selection (SQL vs. NoSQL)
- Architecture evolution

### Communication Patterns
- Synchronous (REST, gRPC)
- Asynchronous (message queues, event streams)
- Service-to-service communication
- API design and versioning

### Data Flow
- Request/response patterns
- Event-driven flows
- Data pipeline architecture
- State management

### Observability
- Monitoring and metrics
- Logging and tracing
- Alerting strategies
- Debugging distributed systems
