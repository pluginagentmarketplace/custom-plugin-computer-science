# 5-Minute Quick Start

Get up and running with the Computer Science Plugin in minutes.

## Step 1: Install (30 seconds)

In Claude Code:
```
/plugin add ./custom-plugin-computer-science
```

Or:
```
/plugin add ~/.claude-code/plugins/computer-science
```

## Step 2: Choose Your Path (1 minute)

```
/learn foundations      ← Start with math & logic (4 weeks)
/learn algorithms       ← Master problem solving (8 weeks)
/learn full-path        ← Complete education (24 weeks)
```

**First-timer?** Run `/learn foundations`

## Step 3: Solve Problems (3 minutes)

```
/problem arrays easy    ← Find easy array problems
/problem two-sum hint   ← Get hints for two-sum problem
/problem two-sum solution ← See the solution explained
```

## Step 4: Test Knowledge (30 seconds)

```
/quiz foundations easy  ← Take easy foundations quiz
/quiz all comprehensive ← Full assessment across all domains
```

## Step 5: Analyze Performance (30 seconds)

```
/analyze merge-sort     ← Understand merge sort complexity
/analyze compare binary linear ← Compare algorithms
```

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Foundations** (1-2 weeks)
   - Run `/learn foundations`
   - Solve 30 foundation problems
   - Take foundations quiz

2. **Master Algorithms** (2-3 weeks)
   - Run `/learn algorithms`
   - Solve 100+ algorithm problems
   - Take algorithms quiz

3. **Interview Prep** (1-2 weeks)
   - Focus on hard problems
   - Take mock interviews
   - Review weak areas

## Tips

- **Practice daily:** 30-60 mins beats weekend cramming
- **Use hints:** 3-level hints help without spoiling
- **Understand, not memorize:** Read solutions completely
- **Track progress:** `/quiz stats` shows improvements

## Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/learn` | Learning paths | `/learn algorithms` |
| `/problem` | Solve problems | `/problem arrays medium` |
| `/analyze` | Complexity analysis | `/analyze merge-sort` |
| `/quiz` | Test knowledge | `/quiz all comprehensive` |

## Struggling?

- **With concepts?** Use `/learn [topic]` for guided explanations
- **With problems?** Use `/problem [name] hint` for help
- **With complexity?** Use `/analyze [algorithm]` for breakdown
- **Testing knowledge?** Use `/quiz [domain]` to assess

## Common Questions

**Q: How long to become proficient?**
A: Foundations + Algorithms = 8-10 weeks with consistent 1hr daily practice.

**Q: Can I use this for interviews?**
A: Yes! Problem set designed specifically for tech interviews.

**Q: Do I need prior CS knowledge?**
A: No. Start with `/learn foundations` (all explained).

**Q: Can I pick specific topics?**
A: Yes. Each command supports filtering by category/difficulty.
