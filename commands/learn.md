## Learning Features

### Progress Tracking
- Track problems solved (count, pass rate)
- Time spent per topic
- Weak areas identified
- Weekly summary reports

### Interactive Tools
- **Problem browser:** Category, difficulty filter
- **Hint system:** 3-level hints (avoid spoilers)
- **Solution judge:** Auto-test your code
- **Comparison tool:** Your solution vs optimal

### Community Features

## How Learning Works

### Day-to-day
1. **Read concept:** Quick intro with examples
2. **Practice:** Solve 3-5 problems on topic
3. **Check solutions:** Understand optimal approach
4. **Reflect:** What patterns did I see?

### Weekly
1. **Review:** Recap week's patterns
2. **Practice:** Mix easy + hard problems
3. **Assess:** Take weekly quiz
4. **Adjust:** Spend extra time on weak areas

### Milestones
- Week 1 complete → Unlock next week
- Pattern quiz 80%+ → Progress
- 50% problems solved → Check understanding
- All problems 100% → Master topic

## Tips for Success

### Time Management
- **Best practice:** 30-60 mins daily > 5 hours weekend
- **Consistency matters:** Learning compounds
- **Take breaks:** Avoid burnout

### When Stuck
- **Hint system:** Use level 1-3 hints
- **Discuss:** Forums help (don't spoil for others)
- **Sleep on it:** Fresh perspective helps
- **Abandon if 30 mins:** Come back later

### Optimize Learning
- **Active recall:** Test yourself, don't just read
- **Spaced repetition:** Review 1 week later
- **Interleaving:** Mix topics, don't single-focus
- **Elaboration:** Explain to someone else
