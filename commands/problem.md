## Common Patterns

**Two Pointer Technique**
- Move from opposite ends
- Meet in middle
- Examples: two sum sorted, container with water

**Sliding Window**
- Maintain fixed/variable window
- Track window state
- Examples: longest substring, minimum window

**Binary Search**
- Search in sorted data
- O(log n) solution
- Examples: search in rotated array

**DFS/BFS**
- Graph traversal
- Stack vs queue
- Examples: connected components, shortest path

**DP State**
- Define state clearly
- Identify transitions
- Base cases correct
- Examples: Fibonacci, knapsack
